```

into this:

~~~ info
A beautifully styled message.
~~~

## Usage

### A basic `admonish` block

Use any [fenced code-block](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#fenced-code-blocks) as you normally would, but annotate it with `admonish <admonition type>`:

```
~~~admonish example
My example is the best!
~~~
```

~~~admonish example
My example is the best!
~~~

See the [list of directives](./reference.md#directives) for a full list of supported admonitions. You'll find:

- `info`
- `warning`
- `danger`
- `example`

and quite a few more!

You can also leave out the admonition type altogether, in which case it will default to `note`:

```
~~~admonish
A plain note.
~~~
```

~~~admonish
A plain note.
~~~

### Invalid blocks

By default, if an `admonish` block cannot be parsed, an error will be rendered in the output:

```
~~~admonish title="\j"
This block will error
~~~
```

~~~admonish title="\j"
This block will error
~~~

You can also configure the build to fail loudly, by setting `on_failure = "bail"` in `book.toml`. See the [configuration reference](./reference.md#booktoml-configuration) for more details.

### Additional Options

You can pass additional options to each block. Options are given like a [TOML Inline Table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#inline-table), as key-value pairs separated by commas.

`mdbook-admonish` parses options by wrapping your options in an inline table before parsing them, so please consult [The TOML Reference](https://toml.io) if you run into any syntax errors. Be aware that:

- Key-value pairs must be separated with a comma `,`
- TOML escapes must be escaped again - for instance, write `\"` as `\\"`.
- For complex strings such as HTML, you may want to use a [literal string](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string) to avoid complex escape sequences

Note that some options can be passed globally, through the `default` section in `book.toml`. See the [configuration reference](./reference.md#booktoml-configuration) for more details.

#### Custom title

A custom title can be provided:

```
~~~admonish warning title="Data loss"
The following steps can lead to irrecoverable data corruption.
~~~
```

~~~admonish warning title="Data loss"
The following steps can lead to irrecoverable data corruption.
~~~

You can also remove the title bar entirely, by specifying the empty string:

```
~~~admonish success title=""
This will take a while, go and grab a drink of water.
~~~
```

~~~admonish success title=""
This will take a while, go and grab a drink of water.
~~~

#### Nested Markdown/HTML

Markdown and HTML can be used in the inner content, as you'd expect:

```
~~~admonish tip title='_Referencing_ and <i>dereferencing</i>'
The opposite of *referencing* by using `&` is *dereferencing*, which is
accomplished with the <span style="color: hotpink">dereference operator</span>, `*`.
~~~
```

~~~admonish tip title='_Referencing_ and <i>dereferencing</i>'
The opposite of *referencing* by using `&` is *dereferencing*, which is
accomplished with the <span style="color: hotpink">dereference operator</span>, `*`.
~~~

If you have code blocks you want to include in the content, use [tildes for the outer code fence](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#fenced-code-blocks):


````
~~~admonish bug
This syntax won't work in Python 3:
```python
print "Hello, world!"
```
~~~
````

```admonish bug
This syntax won't work in Python 3:
~~~python
print "Hello, world!"
~~~
```

#### Custom styling

If you want to provide custom styling to a specific admonition, you can attach one or more custom classnames:

```
~~~admonish note title="Stylish", class="custom-0 custom-1"
Styled with my custom CSS class.
~~~
```

Will yield something like the following HTML, which you can then apply styles to:

```html
<div class="admonition note custom-0 custom-1"
    ...
</div>
```

#### Collapsible

For a block to be initially collapsible, and then be openable, set `collapsible=true`:

```
~~~admonish title="Sneaky", collapsible=true
Content will be hidden initially.
~~~
```

Will yield something like the following HTML, which you can then apply styles to:

~~~admonish title="Sneaky", collapsible=true
Content will be hidden initially.
~~~

### Custom blocks

You can add new block types via the `book.toml` config:

```toml
# book.toml

[[preprocessor.admonish.custom]]
directive = "expensive"
icon = "./money-bag.svg"
color = "#24ab38"
aliases = ["money", "cash", "budget"]
```

You must then generate the relevant CSS file, and reference it in the `output.html` section.
`mdbook-admonish` has a helper to quickly do this for you:

```bash
# Generates a file at ./mdbook-admonish-custom.css with your styles in
$ mdbook-admonish generate-custom ./mdbook-admonish-custom.css
```

```toml
# book.toml

[output.html]
# Reference the new file, so it's bundled in with book styles
additional-css = ["./mdbook-admonish.css", "./mdbook-admonish-custom.css"]
```

You can then reference the new directive (or alias) like usual in your blocks.

```
~~~admonish title='expensive'
Remember, this operation costs money!
~~~
```

~~~admonish title='expensive'
Remember, this operation costs money!
~~~
