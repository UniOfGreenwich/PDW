# Introduction: Continous Integration

1. Create a repository on Github, call it what you want. 

2. Next clone it to your system. 

3. Create the following directory 

    ~~~admonish terminal

    ```
    $ mkdir -p .github/workflows
    ```

    ~~~

4. Create the following the following file inside of `.github/workflows/` called `check_readme.yml` and place the following inside the that file: 

    ~~~admonish code

    ```yaml
    name: README Check

    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main  # Change this to your main branch name if different

    jobs:
    check-readme:
        name: Check README
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        
        steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
        - name: Check for README.md
        run: |
            if [ ! -f README.md ]; then
            echo "ERROR: README.md not found!"
            exit 1
            fi
        
        - name: Check README headings - Level 1
        run: |
            if ! grep -q '^# Introduction' README.md; then
            echo "ERROR: Introduction heading missing!"
            exit 1
            fi
            if ! grep -q '^# Description' README.md; then
            echo "ERROR: Description heading missing!"
            exit 1
            fi
        
        - name: Check README headings - Level 2
        run: |
            if ! grep -q '^## Author' README.md; then
            echo "ERROR: Author heading missing!"
            exit 1
            fi
            if ! grep -q '^## License' README.md; then
            echo "ERROR: License heading missing!"
            exit 1
            fi
    ```

5. Here is what is going on: 

  - This line specifies the name of the workflow. It will be displayed in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
    
      ~~~admonish terminal

      ```yaml
      name: README Check
      ```
      
      ~~~

  - This section defines when the workflow should be triggered. In this case, it triggers on every push to the main branch. You can adjust the branch name if your main branch is named differently.
      
      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml
      on:
      push:
          branches:
          - main  # Change this to your main branch name if different
      ```
      ~~~

  - This part starts defining the jobs to be executed. In this case, there is only one job named check-readme. It runs on an Ubuntu environment (specifically, the latest version).
      
      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml
      jobs:
      check-readme:
          name: Check README
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      ```
      ~~~

  - This step checks out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout@v2` action. It ensures that the workflow has access to the codebase.

      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml
      steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      ```

      ~~~

  - This step runs a shell script to check if the README.md file exists in the repository. If the file doesn't exist, it prints an error message and exits the workflow with a non-zero status code.

      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml 
          - name: Check for README.md
        run: |
          if [ ! -f README.md ]; then
            echo "ERROR: README.md not found!"
            exit 1
          fi
      ```

      ~~~

  - This step checks for level 1 headings (# Heading) in the README.md file. It uses grep to search for the specific heading. If the heading is not found, it prints an error message and exits the workflow with a non-zero status code.
      
      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml
      - name: Check README headings - Level 1
      run: |
      if ! grep -q '^# Introduction' README.md; then
          echo "ERROR: Introduction heading missing!"
          exit 1
      fi
      if ! grep -q '^# Description' README.md; then
          echo "ERROR: Description heading missing!"
          exit 1
      fi
      ```

      ~~~

  - Similar to the previous step, this one checks for level 2 headings (## Heading) in the README.md file. It uses grep to search for the specific headings (Author and License). If any of the headings are not found, it prints an error message and exits the workflow with a non-zero status code.
      
      ~~~admonish code

      ```yaml
      - name: Check README headings - Level 2
          run: |
          if ! grep -q '^## Author' README.md; then
              echo "ERROR: Author heading missing!"
              exit 1
          fi
          if ! grep -q '^## License' README.md; then
              echo "ERROR: License heading missing!"
              exit 1
          fi
      ``` 

      ~~~
      
6. Create a `README.md` and add the `# Introduction` to the first line

7. `$ git commit -am "add: add README.md and check_readme.yaml`

8. `$ git push`

9. Now go to the repo on line and watch the **actions** unfold.

10. Try to pass each test.
